## Briefly About Myself:
The first thing I consciously and professionally began to do was floristry! Working as a florist, I learned to communicate with a variety of people, maintaining good relationships. And for a long time he created beauty through flowers and greenery. However, my desire for something more made me go forward! I lacked room for imagination and freedom. Then I decided to
themselves to master the virtual world, its tools. So that nothing limits the flight of my imagination, and I myself can write my own laws, according to which everything will work! So, in November 2022, I started studying at the Cursor Lithuanian School of Programming, which I successfully graduated on July 28, 2023.
Full of determination and a strong desire to become a professional in my field, I signed up for a course at the RS School to consolidate the knowledge gained at the Cursor School and learn something new. I want to own everything that is necessary for the sake of that childhood dream of mine - to create and create something new at the highest level!
